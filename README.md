🌿 Branch Structure

The repository is organized into three main branches. The main branch contains the frontend code developed using React, which includes the user interface and client-side logic of the application. The backend branch holds the Node.js and Express code that powers the server-side functionality, including API endpoints, database interactions, and business logic. Lastly, the admin branch is dedicated to the admin panel, where administrators can manage movies, theaters, show timings, and bookings separately from the main user-facing interface. This separation ensures modularity and cleaner development workflows.
